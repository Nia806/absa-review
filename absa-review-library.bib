   abstract = {Opinion mining or sentiment analysis analyses the text written in a natural language about a topic and classify them as positive negative or neutral based on the human"s sentiments, emotion, opinions expressed in it. Nowadays user reviews and comments on travels on the web are increasing day by day. These comments are useful for other users to make a decision in travel planning. The manual analysis of such huge number of reviews is practically impossible. To solve this problem an automated approach of a machine to mine the overall sentiment or opinion polarity form the reviews is needed. Opinion mining can be done at three different levels, which are document level, sentence level and aspect level. Most of the previous work is in the field of document or sentence level sentiment analysis. This paper focus on the aspect based opinion mining of restaurant reviews, i.e. given a set of reviews of a restaurant we get a sentiment profile of its important features automatically. A different approach proposed for opinion mining which uses SentiWordNet, two word phrases and linguistic rules together for opinion mining.},

Based on aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), this study investigates the effect of customer-generated content (i.e., online reviews) in predicting restaurant survival using datasets for restaurants in two world famous tourism destinations in the United States. ABSA divides the overall review sentiment of each online review into five categories, namely location, tastiness, price, service, and atmosphere. By employing the machine learning–based conditional survival forest model, empirical results show that compared with overall review sentiment, aspect-based sentiment for various factors can improve the prediction performance of restaurant survival. Based on feature importance analysis, this study also highlights the effects of different types of aspect sentiment on restaurant survival prediction to identify which features of online reviews are optimal indicators of restaurant survival.},

   abstract = {Advances in information technology have given rise to online hotel reservation options. The user review feature is an important factor during the online booking of hotels. Generally, most online hotel booking service providers provide review and rating features for assessing hotels. However, not all service providers provide rating features or recap reviews for every aspect of the hotel services offered. Therefore, we propose a method to summarise reviews based on multiple aspects, including food, room, service, and location. This method uses long short-term memory (LSTM), together with hidden layers and automation of the optimal number of hidden neurons. The F1-measure value of 75.28% for the best model was based on the fact that (i) the size of the first hidden layer is 1,200 neurons with the tanh activation function, and (ii) the size of the second hidden layer is 600 neurons with the ReLU activation function. The proposed model outperforms the baseline model (also known as standard LSTM) by 10.16%. It is anticipated that the model developed through this study can be accessed by users of online hotel booking services to acquire a review recap on more specific aspects of services offered by hotels.},

   abstract = {On the post-pandemic recovery green economy track, especially in the hospitality and tourism industry, businesses must accelerate digital transformation and enter the race to increase customer experience. Improving customer experience is critical, and understanding customers’ emotions and needs after using hotel services is crucial. This is why businesses increasingly rely on online customer reviews on booking sites to gain insight into what their customers seek. By understanding their needs and experiences, hotel managers can provide services that meet customer expectations and improve overall service quality. Although online review analysis is meaningful for hotel managers because of its practicality in business operations, a specific model, method, or tool is needed to explore customer emotions. This study proposes a method to analyze customers’ online reviews of Vietnamese hotel services. With a Data set of 20,551 reviews collected from TripAdvisor, the study examines customers’ perceptions of Vietnamese hotel services overall and aspects of hotel services by combining language rules of natural language and inferential statistics. The key findings indicate that customers are most satisfied with the “place” aspect of hotels, with a satisfaction rate of 78%, while the “room” service aspect has the lowest satisfaction rate at 61.3%. These results have recommended that hotel managers in Vietnam prioritize understanding customers’ sentiments and opinions to improve service quality in aspects where satisfaction rates are lower.},

Sentiment analysis aims to determine the sentiment value, often on a positive–negative scale, for a given product or service based on a set of textual reviews. As fine-grained information is more useful than just a single overall score, modern aspect-based sentiment analysis techniques break down the sentiment and assign sentiment scores to various aspects of the product or service mentioned in the review. In this work, we focus on aspect-based sentiment analysis for complete reviews, as opposed to determining sentiment for aspects per sentence. Furthermore, we focus on semantic enrichment by employing ontology features in determining the sentiment value of a given pair of review and aspect. Next to that, we compare a pure review-level algorithm with aggregating the sentiment values of individual sentences. We show that the ontology features are important to correctly determine the sentiment of aspects and that the pure review-level algorithm outperforms the sentence aggregation method.},

Sentiment analysis (SA) is the umbrella term for techniques and approaches that analyze user’s sentiments, emotions, opinions in text or other media. The need for a better understanding of these opinions paved the way to novel approaches that focus on the analysis of the sentiment related to specific features of a product, giving birth to the field of aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA). Although the increasing interest in this discipline, there is still confusion regarding the basic concepts of ABSA: terms like sentiment, affect, emotion, opinion, are used as synonyms while they represent different concepts. This often leads to an incorrect analysis of the users’ opinions.This work presents an overview of the state-of-the-art techniques and approaches for ABSA, highlighting the main critical issues related to current trends in this field. Following this analysis, a new reference model for SA and ABSA, namely the KnowMIS-ABSA model, is proposed. The model is grounded on the consideration that sentiment, affect, emotion and opinion are very different concepts and that it is profoundly wrong to use the same metric and the same technique to measure them. Accordingly, we argue that different tools and metrics should be adopted to measure each of the dimensions of an opinion. A qualitative case study, regarding product reviews, is proposed to motivate the advantages of the KnowMIS-ABSA model.},

   abstract = {In today's digital age, customer feedback, particularly gathered from various sources like mobile application reviews, has emerged as a critical resource for service-providing organizations to gain valuable insights into their customers' experiences. As the key objective of service-providing organizations is to facilitate their customers with better services, customer feedback or opinion is a vital resource for such organizations to improve and enhance their services for the betterment of their customers. Explicitly mentioned opinions have been widely studied in research, while a significant gap exists in addressing implicitly described views. Furthermore, most existing research focuses on product-oriented corpora, emphasizing specific product aspects and features. This article presents a novel study on performing end-to-end aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) by extracting implicit opinion terms, categorizing them, and assigning polarity to each term from mobile app reviews in English. Through this study, we developed a domain-specific, service-oriented, and aspect-based annotated dataset and introduced a novel two-step hybrid approach. The first step involves extracting multiple opinion terms using a rule-based approach. The second step employs machine learning and deep learning algorithms to classify the extracted opinion terms into general aspect categories. This two-step approach effectively addresses the double-implicit problem commonly encountered in the previous work on implicit aspects and opinion mining. In addition to traditional machine learning and deep learning models, we fine-tuned BERT to carry out the ABSA task. This approach utilized a pipeline method, where each task's output serves as the subsequent task's input, ensuring a seamless flow of information and improved performance. This multi-step pipeline begins with the extracted opinion terms classification into aspect categories and ends with the assignment of sentiment polarity. Experiments with a hold-out test set for the first step (opinion term extraction using a rule-based approach) achieved an accuracy and precision score of 81.4% and an F1 score of 0.99 %, outperforming several baselines. Further experiments with a range of machine learning and deep learning algorithms for classifying extracted opinion terms into general aspect categories yielded accuracy scores ranging from 0.68% to 0.74 % and F1 scores ranging from 0.23% to 0.28%. Experiments on sentiment classification using various machine learning algorithms showed accuracy ranges from 0.58% to 0.68% and F1 scores from 0.47% to 0.49%. This two-step approach for implicit opinion term, aspect extraction, and classification outperforms many baseline systems. By leveraging BERT's contextual understanding and fine-tuning it for our specific domain, we significantly improved the accuracy and robustness of our aspect-based sentiment analysis. This approach effectively captured both explicit and implicit opinions from mobile app reviews. Specifically, our method achieved an accuracy of 0.80% and an F1 score of 0.78% for aspect categorization, and an accuracy of 0.79% and an F1 score of 0.70% for sentiment classification, demonstrating substantial improvements over traditional methods.},

   abstract = {Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA), also known as fine-grained opinion mining, is a crucial task focused on understanding the sentiment expressed in a text with respect to specific aspects. This paper tackles the challenge of aspect-based sentiment analysis in the hospitality domain by proposing HOSSemEval-EB23, a novel dataset designed to address several limitations in existing resources. The new dataset not only fills the gaps found in other datasets but also broadens the range of domains within aspect-based sentiment analysis. The effectiveness of HOSSemEval-EB23 is evaluated by applying state-of-the-art aspect-based sentiment analysis models, such as variants of TAS Transformers and generative models like T5. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves the best performance with TAS-BERTMEDIUM, reaching an F1-score of 79.74. Moreover, HOSSemEval-EB23 shows superior performance in capturing sentiment towards different aspects within sub-sentences of reviews compared to existing datasets. Consequently, HOSSemEval-EB23 represents a unique and valuable resource for researchers and practitioners aiming to improve the accuracy and scope of aspect-based sentiment analysis in this field.},

   abstract = {User-generated content has become an essential factor influencing customer choice in the selection of hotel and bed and breakfast (BNB) accommodation. It is important for entrepreneurs to effectively analyze customer reviews. From the perspective of BNB managers, it is necessary to know customer opinions relating to specific aspects of the services they have received. Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) evaluates customer sentiments and opinions and can be used to improve services. We propose a framework for automated ABSA of reviews. The framework contains modules for data preprocessing, a multi-task Chinese aspect-based sentiment analysis module, and a Kano module. The Kano module divided service attributes into several distinct categories including must-be, one-dimensional, and attractive attributes… and so on. This module is integrated into our analytical framework to elucidate the relationships between hotel service offerings and customer attributes. The framework is used for a dataset crawled from Google Maps hotel reviews with aspect categories labeled by domain experts. The experimental results demonstrate the excellent performance of this method. We categorize customer requirements based on the aggregate consumer preferences estimated by the Kano module. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated in an empirical evaluation and the utility of the proposed Kano module demonstrated.},

   abstract = {Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained type of sentiment analysis that identifies aspects and their associated opinions from a given text. With the surge of digital opinionated text data, ABSA gained increasing popularity for its ability to mine more detailed and targeted insights. Many review papers on ABSA subtasks and solution methodologies exist, however, few focus on trends over time or systemic issues relating to research application domains, datasets, and solution approaches. To fill the gap, this paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) of ABSA studies with a focus on trends and high-level relationships among these fundamental components. This review is one of the largest SLRs on ABSA. To our knowledge, it is also the first to systematically examine the interrelations among ABSA research and data distribution across domains, as well as trends in solution paradigms and approaches. Our sample includes 727 primary studies screened from 8550 search results without time constraints via an innovative automatic filtering process. Our quantitative analysis not only identifies trends in nearly two decades of ABSA research development but also unveils a systemic lack of dataset and domain diversity as well as domain mismatch that may hinder the development of future ABSA research. We discuss these findings and their implications and propose suggestions for future research.},
